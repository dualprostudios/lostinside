Lost Inside
==========

Codename Lost Inside is a project that Dual-Pro Studios is currently working on.
Currently only 5% of the game is done (even the engine isn't done), and we are 
working day and night in order to gain some progress. Dual-Pro Studios is composed
of two members, hence the name "Dual". We are two people who enjoy coding and
caffein (not sure how to spell :P). Me, Altan, is the person who does the coding,
while my partner, Hanson, is the creative one (he does the artwork).

Thats all there is to this project! We hope you enjoy your stay!
